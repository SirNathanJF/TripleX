# TripleX
This is my first C++ project/program that I created while going through a Udemy course for C++ development. I had a lot of fun with this, and the simple game has some story line from the fantasy series "The Wheel of Time" by Robert Jordan. It uses some simple random number generation and guessing based on local time.

The executible can be downloaded and played if you would like to give it a shot!
